=  Basic UofC Git Workflow

This is just a quick overview of the commands that would be used most frequently:

*  Make your code changes
*  `git status` -> Displays the files that have been changed. Green files means that it has been added. Red means that it is not added.
*  `git add <file>` -> Add files so they could be committed.
*  `git commit -m 'Enter a logical git message'` -> Make a commit local to your computer
*  `git pull` -> Pull down any changes that were done by other people
*  `git push` -> Send your changes so other people can use them.

Here are some other commands that are still used frequently:

*  `git checkout -b <newBranchName>` -> Make a new branch local to your computer
*  `git checkout <branchName>` -> Go to an existing branch
*  `git push --set-upstream origin <newBranchName>` -> Pushes a new branch from your computer to the 'origin' (Github) for the FIRST time. All subsequent pushes can just use the `git push` command as listed above.
